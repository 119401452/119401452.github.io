	      <h3>School Work Experience</h3>
		  <br>
		     <ul>
			    <li><strong>Rochestown Park Hotel Leisure Centre</strong></li>
				     <p>In Rochestown Park Hotel I was being taught on how to do stuff such as; Take a ph reading of the pool water to ensure the correct chlorine levels were present at all times.</p>
					 <p>I was also placed on duty of power washing the sauna and steam room. On top of this they temporarily placed me on duty of lifeguarding on certain occassions. This taught me</p>
					 <p>Great independence skills which have stuck with me since. Aswell, they often instructed me to clean the gym i.e clean the mirrors and put back loose weights on the gym floor.</p>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Citco</strong></li>
				     <p>In Citco I was introduced to the many aspects both (1) Phyical and (2) Internal compenents of a computer. At the beggining of my time here it was mainly physical which I did </p>
					 <p>really enjoyed. After , I was allowed to sit in on some specialist employees and see what they were working on. I found this experience far more entertaining and enjoyable.</p>
					 <p>This experience is where my love and interest for computers and their endless possibilities was birthed.</p>

	      <h3>Part-Time Work Experience</h3>
		  <br>
		     <ul>
			    <li><strong>Wisetek Carrigtwohill</strong></li>
				     <p>In Wistek I was put in to role of drive strip. This role was very important in the process of the overall aims that had to be met on a weekly basis. This work included stripping</p>
					 <p>down hard drives and retrieving the paddle sticks from them. We then proceeded to scan the paddle sticks to see if they were recyclable or not. I personally enjoyed this work as</p>
					 <p>it gave me a real sense of meaning and need within the company.</p>
				<br>
				<li><strong>McDonalds Mahon Point</strong></li>
				     <p>In Mcdonalds, I work in the service area of the restaurant. This work includes; Making McFlurry's, Pouring drinks, Order taking, Order Presenting, Order assembly etc...</p>
					 <p>I personally enjoy my work in McDonalds as I enjoy working with Customers and helping make people have a more enjoyable experience. I also enjoy this work due to my fellow</p>
					 <p>collegues as they are very kind and are always willing to help me whenever I require assistance.</p><br>
